avidii is an 24x7 Online support on Instant Home Tutoring, Doubt Solving and Homework Help for CBSE, ICSE and State Board Students
On-demand edtech platform Avidii has entered India, all the way from Switzerland. The startup claims to have onboarded more than 400 tutors across India.

Launched in 2021, by Deepak Subbarao, Roman Buhler, Xavier Vanderhaeghe and Yannick Streicher, in Zurich, Switzerland, it started its full-fledged operations in India in early 2023 from Bengaluru.

According to Avidii’s statement, it is operational across four countries, currently and aims to achieve 1 Mn users and downloads in India by the end of this year.

Avidii provides on-demand and customised learning solutions for Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology along with Commerce and Arts subjects, primarily for students between the ages of 11 and 18.

Further, it caters to the students following the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) board, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Examination (ICSE), and State Boards curricula.

The startup’s offerings include 24×7 direct and instant connection between the tutors and the students following both B2B and B2C business models.

Commenting on its operations, cofounder Deepak Subbarao said, “At Avidii, Tutors use a variety of advanced teaching tools—such as digital whiteboard, graphic annotation features and sharing of learning materials—to create comprehensive learning sessions for the students.”

The startup claims that for being an on-demand platform, it doesn’t seek a minimum time period from students to complete a course, and counts this as the USP.

The platform’s on-demand nature and lack of required commitment for any minimum period differentiates it from other edtech players in the country.

According to Avidii, the tutors of the platform address every doubt raised by the students individually. In addition, it also offers remote working options to the tutors.

Some of the major competitors of Avidii in the country include the likes of BYJU’S, Physics Wallah, etc.

Also recently, Scaler has announced the acquisition of Delhi-based Pepcoding for an undisclosed amount.

According to the Inc42 Edtech Report 2022, the Indian startups in the edtech space, raised a total of $2.4 Bn across 95 deals in 2022.
